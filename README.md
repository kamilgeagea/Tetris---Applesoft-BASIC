# Tetris Applesoft BASIC

I built this Tetris game with Applesoft BASIC with my dad. He used to own an Apple II back in the 70s/80s. It was fun to see how Software was developed back in the day, it really makes you appreciate the tools that make the job simple nowadays.

## How to use:

1. Visit: https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/
2. Paste the content of [Tetris-Applesoft-BASIC.txt](https://github.com/kamilgeagea/Tetris-Applesoft-BASIC/blob/main/Tetris-Applesoft-BASIC.txt) in the text box.
3. Left and Right arrows to move Left and Right, Up arrow to rotate the shape

*Disclaimer:* We're not changing random seed so the order of the shapes is the same for every execution. You can change the SHPSD variable to get a random order.
